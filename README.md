## Introduction
Netflix generates more than $25 billion in income each year. It features an extensive range of movies and TV shows, many high-quality original programs, and an easy-to-use interface. Netflix continues to work on growing its catalog. You‚Äôve probably had a conversation with a friend about a movie or a TV show, and one of you added

‚ÄúAnd to top it all off, it‚Äôs available on Netflix!‚Äù

Actually, many prefer Netflix to alternative streaming services and television programs. 

But why is that? What do the newly added movies and TV series data imply? Are there any patterns or trends? In this blog, we will use the CRISP-DM method to understand better the titles that Netflix is adding and its efforts to maintain its leadership in the streaming sector.

Based on our primary business question, ‚ÄúHow Did Netflix Become the Best?‚Äù I‚Äôve defined five questions that can help us understand and answer our main question.

* ‚ÄúIs Netflix adding more content than ever before to its catalog?‚Äù

* ‚ÄúWhich countries‚Äô movies and TV series are being added to Netflix?‚Äù

* ‚ÄúIs there a difference in the number of movies and TV shows added to the catalog based on region?‚Äù

* ‚ÄúWhat were the varied strategies for adding content to regions?‚Äù

* ‚ÄúBased on title rating, who is the target audience for the titles added from the major countries?‚Äù

To answer these questions, I took data from the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset from Kaggle. The dataset includes 8807 titles.
